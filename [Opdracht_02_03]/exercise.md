- Write a program that generates 25 random int values. For each
value, use an if-else statement to classify it as greater than, less
than or equal to a second randomly-generated value.
- Write a program that uses two nested for loops and the modulus
  operator (%) to detect and print prime numbers (integral numbers
  that are not evenly divisible by any other numbers except for
  themselves and 1).
